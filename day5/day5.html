        About
    </strong><br>
      <p><b>Programming</b> is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
        Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, 
        and C++.</p>
    <h3>
    Why should you bother about coding?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Computers are fast:</b>  computers are amazingly fast. If you know how to properly utilize the power of Computer programming, you can do wonders with it. For a typical computer of today’s time, an addition of 2 numbers which could be as big as a billion each takes hardly a nanosecond. </li>
        <li><b>Computers are cheap:</b> if you were a stock market analyst and you had to monitor the data of say 1000 stocks so that you can quickly trade them. Imagine the hassle that would create if you were to do it manually! It is just impractical. While you are performing your calculation on the stock’s performance, the price may change. </li>
        <li><b>Computers can work 24x7:</b>Computers can work 24x7 without getting exhausted. So, if you have a task that is big enough, you can without worries allocate it to a computer by programming it and sleep peacefully.</li>
